# T-Dropper

**T-Dropper** is a full-stack decentralized application for airdropping ERC20 tokens to multiple recipients. Built with **Solidity (Foundry)** for smart contracts and **Next.js** for the frontend, it allows seamless, gas-efficient token distributions via a secure and user-friendly web interface.

## Overview

- **Smart Contract:** Airdrops ERC20 tokens to a list of recipients with one-time validation.
- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel, providing a simple interface for inputting recipients and amounts.
- **Wallet Integration:** Users can connect with wallets via RainbowKit.
- **Chain:** Deployed to **Sepolia Testnet** and **local Anvil** chain.
- **Testing:** Includes contract-level tests and component tests using **Vitest**.

## How It Works

1. **Pre-validation:** Users can pre-check recipient addresses and amounts using `isValidRecipientsAndAmounts` to avoid gas waste.
2. **Airdrop Execution:** Once validated, the `airdropERC20` function performs the token transfer to all recipients in a single transaction.
3. **Gas Optimization:** Separating validation from execution avoids redundant checks.

## Smart Contracts

The project includes a single main smart contract:

### `TDropper.sol`

- Handles batch ERC20 token airdrops.
- Uses `SafeERC20` for secure transfers.
- Key features:
  - Validation function to pre-check recipients and amounts.
  - Custom errors for clear reverts.
  - Protects against zero addresses, mismatched arrays, and incorrect totals.

## Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js (static export mode)
- **Wallets:** RainbowKit + wagmi (using viem under the hood)
- **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Testing:** Vitest for component testing
